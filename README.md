### Project Reflection
#### 1. This project did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach the design and problem solving process for this project?
- Figured out what the minimum we could do on the project was, then started brainstorming our approach. We code spiked Iteration 1 and then discussed the pros and cons of each process. Then we set up a project board to divy up our tasks and tackle the project in pieces. We utilized Slack regularly, and Zoom meetings when necessary, to discuss progress, blockers and continued developement. After Iteration 3 we each selected extensions we were interested in and worked those problems separately.
#### 2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
- Implementing a server or webpage deployment for the project, and allowing multi player functionality. Refactor redundant code that could be placed into Modules, or behaviors that could be simplified to one class.
#### 3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
- Code spikes for hashing out ideas and refining them
- driver-navigator to troubleshoot tricky bugs
- async programming to tackle project in small bites, and combine them
- Git branching and git workflow
#### 4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
- Abruptly and without remorse....Nah in a good way through Zoom mostly
